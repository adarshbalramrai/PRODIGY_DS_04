This project aims to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. By harnessing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we extract sentiments from social media posts and represent them visually for easy interpretation.
Sentiment Analysis: Utilize state-of-the-art NLP algorithms to analyze the sentiment of social media content.
Topic Detection: Identify relevant topics or keywords within the social media data to focus the analysis.
Visualizations: Present sentiment trends through intuitive visualizations such as line charts, histograms, or word clouds.
Brand Monitoring: Monitor and analyze sentiment towards specific brands or products mentioned in social media conversations.
Customization: Customize the analysis parameters and visualization styles to fit specific research or business needs.
